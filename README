tsconverter -- timestamp converter
--------------------------------------------------

There are probably a thousand of these already out there but I just
wanted to be able to say I have a project hosted somewhere.

The program is super simple and probably full of bugs. just add an
integer on the command line and it attempts to convert it to a date
based on the unix epoch. I make no guaranees and I don't care how many
lawyers you find, you should know better than to trust code you find on
the internet.
